## Development Setup

### Using Docker Compose
1. Run `docker-compose up -d`
2. Migrations and seeding happen automatically
3. API available at `http://localhost:5000`
4. Blazor UI available at `http://localhost:5001`

### Local Development
1. Ensure PostgreSQL is running
2. Update connection string in `appsettings.Development.json`
3. Run `dotnet run` from the API project
4. Migrations and seeding happen automatically

## Testing Authentication

### Using Swagger UI
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:5000/swagger`
2. Use the `/api/auth/login` endpoint
3. Copy the returned access token
4. Click "Authorize" button in Swagger UI
5. Enter: `Bearer {your-access-token}`

### Using Blazor UI
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:5001`
2. Click "Login" 
3. Use any seeded user credentials
4. Explore role-based features

## Configuration

### JWT Settings (appsettings.json)
```json
{
  "JwtSettings": {
    "SecretKey": "YourSecretKeyHereWhichShouldBeAtLeast32CharactersLongForProduction",
    "Issuer": "Harmoni360",
    "Audience": "Harmoni360Users",
    "ExpirationInHours": 1
  }
}
```

### Database Connection
```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Host=timescaledb;Database=harmoni360_dev;Username=harmoni360;Password=Harmoni360!2024;Port=5432"
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Invalid email or password"**
   - Verify you're using the correct email from the seeded users list
   - Ensure password is exactly: `Harmoni360!`
   - Check that seeding completed successfully in API logs

2. **"User account is deactivated"**
   - All seeded users are active by default
   - Check if user was manually deactivated

3. **Token validation errors**
   - Verify JWT settings match between issuer and validator
   - Check token hasn't expired (1-hour default)
   - Ensure Bearer prefix is included in Authorization header

4. **Database connection issues**
   - Verify PostgreSQL is running
   - Check connection string matches your database setup
   - Ensure database user has proper permissions

### Logs to Check
- API startup logs for migration and seeding status
- Authentication logs for login attempts
- Database logs for connection issues

## Production Considerations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Before deploying to production:

1. **Change Default Passwords**: All seeded users must have their passwords changed
2. **Update JWT Secret**: Use a strong, unique secret key
3. **Enable HTTPS**: All authentication must use HTTPS
4. **Configure CORS**: Restrict origins to your domains
5. **Review Permissions**: Ensure role permissions match your security requirements
6. **Enable Audit Logging**: Track all authentication events
7. **Set Up Monitoring**: Monitor failed login attempts

## Support

For authentication-related issues:
1. Check this documentation first
2. Review API logs for error details
3. Verify database connectivity and migrations
4. Test with known working credentials (seeded users)
5. Check JWT token claims and expiration
