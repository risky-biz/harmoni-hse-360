# Training Management System Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive implementation plan for the Training Management System in the Harmoni360 HSSE (Health, Safety, Security, Environment) platform. The system will follow established Domain-Driven Design (DDD) patterns, CQRS command/query patterns, and UI/UX standards consistent with existing modules like Work Permits, Inspections, and Audits.

**Objective**: Deliver a feature-complete Training Management System that integrates seamlessly with the existing Harmoni360 architecture, providing robust training capabilities for safety, environmental, equipment, and compliance training in HSE operations.

**Technology Stack**: .NET 8 backend with Entity Framework Core, React 18 + TypeScript frontend, following established architectural patterns and design systems.

## System Architecture

```csharp
public class TrainingConfiguration : IEntityTypeConfiguration<Training>
{
    public void Configure(EntityTypeBuilder<Training> builder)
    {
        builder.ToTable("Trainings");
        
        // Primary Key
        builder.HasKey(e => e.Id);
        
        // Properties
        builder.Property(e => e.TrainingNumber)
            .HasMaxLength(50)
            .IsRequired();
            
        builder.HasIndex(e => e.TrainingNumber)
            .IsUnique();
            
        // Enum conversions following established pattern
        builder.Property(e => e.Type)
            .HasConversion<int>()
            .IsRequired();
            
        builder.Property(e => e.Status)
            .HasConversion<int>()
            .IsRequired();
            
        // Relationships
        builder.HasMany(e => e.Participants)
            .WithOne(p => p.Training)
            .HasForeignKey(p => p.TrainingId)
            .OnDelete(DeleteBehavior.Cascade);
            
        builder.HasMany(e => e.Attachments)
            .WithOne(a => a.Training)
            .HasForeignKey(a => a.TrainingId)
            .OnDelete(DeleteBehavior.Cascade);
            
        // Indexes for performance
        builder.HasIndex(e => e.Status);
        builder.HasIndex(e => e.Type);
        builder.HasIndex(e => e.ScheduledDate);
        builder.HasIndex(e => new { e.Status, e.ScheduledDate });

// 20240101_AddTrainingEntities.cs
public partial class AddTrainingEntities : Migration
{
    protected override void Up(MigrationBuilder migrationBuilder)
    {
        // Create Trainings table with all relationships
        // Add indexes for performance
        // Seed initial configuration data
    }
}
```
