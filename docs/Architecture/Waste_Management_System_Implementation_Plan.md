# Waste Management System Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary
This document outlines the phased implementation strategy for the new Waste Management System within Harmoni360. The goal is to extend the existing HSE modules with comprehensive waste tracking capabilities while following established Clean Architecture patterns.

## Technical Architecture
- **Backend**: .NET 8, Entity Framework Core, PostgreSQL
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript
- **Design Patterns**: CQRS, Repository pattern, Clean Architecture
- **File Storage**: Reuse existing `/app/uploads` infrastructure

## Feature Breakdown
1. Waste Report submission with attachments
2. Waste classification (hazardous, non-hazardous, recyclable)
3. Disposal tracking from generation to final disposal
4. Compliance monitoring and reporting
5. Integration with incident and safety workflows

## Implementation Phases
### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2) ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Define `WasteReport` and `WasteAttachment` entities
- [x] Create repository interface and implementation
- [x] Add Entity Framework configurations and migration
- [x] Register services in dependency injection
- [x] Implement basic API controller (create & list)
- [x] Add frontend API slice and list page skeleton
- [x] Unit test scaffolding

### Phase 2: Core Features (Weeks 3-4) ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Waste report form with validation
- [x] Attachment upload handling with virus scanning
- [x] Listing with filtering, pagination and search
- [x] Security module integration for disposal tracking

### Phase 3: Advanced Capabilities (Weeks 5-6)
- [ ] Dashboard widgets and metrics
- [ ] Compliance reporting exports
- [ ] Role-based permissions and auditing

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing (Weeks 7-8)
- [ ] Full unit and integration tests
- [ ] Frontend component tests
- [ ] Documentation updates and deployment prep

## Current Progress
Implemented form submission with validation, antivirus scanning for attachments, filtered listing, and disposal status tracking.
