# Incident Management System - Manual Test Cases

## Overview
This directory contains comprehensive manual test cases for the HarmoniHSE360 Incident Management System Module. The test cases are organized by functionality and cover all aspects of incident management including creation, updates, attachments, workflow, and access control.

## Test Case Organization

### Test Case Files:
- **CreateIncident.md** - Test cases for incident creation functionality
- **UpdateIncident.md** - Test cases for incident updates and modifications
- **AttachmentManagement.md** - Test cases for file upload and attachment handling
- **IncidentWorkflow.md** - Test cases for status transitions and workflow
- **SearchAndFilter.md** - Test cases for incident search and filtering
- **AccessControl.md** - Test cases for role-based permissions and security
- **ValidationTesting.md** - Test cases for data validation and error handling
- **IntegrationTesting.md** - End-to-end integration test scenarios

## Test Case Format

Each test case follows this standardized format:

```
### Test Case ID: [Unique Identifier]
**Test Objective:** [Clear description of what is being tested]
**Priority:** [High/Medium/Low]
**Prerequisites:** [Required setup or conditions]
**Test Data:** [Specific data needed for the test]

**Test Steps:**
1. [Detailed step-by-step instructions]
2. [Each step should be clear and actionable]
3. [Include expected results for each step]

**Expected Results:**
- [Overall expected outcome]
- [Specific validation points]

**Post-conditions:** [System state after test completion]
```

## Test Environment Requirements

### User Roles Required:
- **Employee** - Basic incident reporting permissions
- **HSE Manager** - Incident management and investigation permissions  
- **Admin** - Full system access and configuration permissions

### Test Data Requirements:
- Valid user accounts for each role
- Sample files for attachment testing (various formats and sizes)
- Test location data with GPS coordinates
- Sample incident data for different severity levels

### Browser Requirements:
- Chrome (latest version)
- Firefox (latest version)
- Edge (latest version)
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)

## Execution Guidelines

### Before Testing:
1. Ensure test environment is properly configured
2. Verify all required user accounts are available
3. Prepare test data files and sample content
4. Clear browser cache and cookies
5. Document environment details (browser version, OS, etc.)

### During Testing:
1. Execute test cases in the specified order
2. Document actual results for each step
3. Take screenshots for any failures or unexpected behavior
4. Note any performance issues or delays
5. Record exact error messages when they occur

### After Testing:
1. Document all defects found with detailed reproduction steps
2. Categorize issues by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
3. Provide recommendations for improvements
4. Update test cases based on any system changes discovered

## Test Coverage Areas

## Defect Reporting

When defects are found, report them using this format:

**Defect ID:** [Unique identifier]
**Test Case ID:** [Related test case]
**Severity:** [Critical/High/Medium/Low]
**Priority:** [High/Medium/Low]
**Summary:** [Brief description]
**Steps to Reproduce:** [Detailed steps]
**Expected Result:** [What should happen]
**Actual Result:** [What actually happened]
**Environment:** [Browser, OS, version details]
**Screenshots:** [Attach relevant screenshots]

## Test Metrics
