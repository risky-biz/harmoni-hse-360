## Data Seeding Considerations

### Existing Seeding Infrastructure Analysis

Based on the current implementation, the data seeding follows a structured approach:

1. **Essential Data** (Always seeded):
   - Roles: 19 roles including new Security and Work Permit roles
   - Module Permissions: All combinations of ModuleType × PermissionType
   - Essential Admin Users: superadmin, developer, admin

2. **Sample User Accounts** (Optional):
   - 18 demo users with specific role assignments
   - Includes specialized managers for each module
   - Security domain specialists
   - Work permit approval specialists

3. **Seeding Strategy**:
   - Uses `ForceReseed` flag for complete database reset
   - Maintains referential integrity during seeding
   - Supports incremental seeding for new features

### Enhanced User Entity Compatibility

**Current User Entity Fields:**
```csharp
- Email, PasswordHash, Name, EmployeeId
- Department, Position, IsActive
- UserRoles collection
- Audit properties (CreatedAt, CreatedBy, etc.)
```

**Required Enhancements for New System:**
- Add HSSE-specific fields (PhoneNumber, EmergencyContact, etc.)
- Add UserStatus enum (replacing IsActive boolean)
- Add security fields (LastLoginAt, FailedLoginAttempts, etc.)
- Add preference fields (PreferredLanguage, TimeZone)

### Data Migration Strategy

1. **Backward Compatibility**:
   - Preserve existing user data during migration
   - Map IsActive boolean to UserStatus.Active/Inactive
   - Set default values for new required fields

2. **Seeder Updates Required**:
   - Update UserDataSeeder to use enhanced User.Create() method
   - Add HSSE-specific field population in seeders
   - Update existing user records with new fields

3. **Permission System Integration**:
   - Existing ModulePermissionMap compatible with enhancements
   - Add new permission types to PermissionType enum
   - Update RoleModulePermissionDataSeeder for new permissions

## Actionable Next Steps
