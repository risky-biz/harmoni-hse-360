# HSE Business Work Flow - Waste Management Flow

## Overview
This workflow describes the comprehensive process for managing different types of waste, including domestic, food, green, hazardous waste, and wastewater, ensuring proper collection, handling, transportation, and disposal in compliance with environmental regulations.

## Waste Categories and Collection

### 1. Domestic Waste Collection
**Source:** Domestic waste is collected from the trash bin
**Process:** Regular collection from designated bins throughout the facility

### 2. Food Waste Collection
**Source:** Food waste is collected from the trash bin
**Process:** Separate collection from kitchen and dining areas

### 3. Green Waste Collection
**Source:** Green waste is collected from the trash bin
**Process:** Collection of organic yard waste, landscaping debris

### 4. Hazardous Waste Collection
**Source:** Hazardous waste is collected from the trash bin
**Process:** Special handling procedures for dangerous materials

### 5. Waste Water Collection
**Source:** Waste Water is collected from the building
**Process:** Collection through building drainage systems

## Main Waste Processing Workflow

### Step 1: Temporary Storage
**Process:**
- The waste is stored in the temporary waste storage
- Segregation and initial processing

### Step 2: Waste Weighing and Documentation
**Process:**
- The waste is weighed and recorded in the report
- **Domestic and hazardous waste:** weighed by the cleaners
- **Food waste:** weighed by the catering vendor
- **Green waste:** weighed by the grounds and landscaping team

### Step 3: Waste Transportation
**Process:**
- The waste transporter picks up the waste on a regular schedule:
  - **Domestic waste**
  - **Food waste** 
  - **Green waste**
- **Hazardous waste:** picked up upon request
- The transporter will reconfirm the weight of the waste by reweighing it

### Step 4: Transport to Disposal
**Process:**
- The transporter takes the waste to the landfill and provides the manifest or report to HSE

### Step 5: Documentation Management
**Process:**
- HSE keeps the waste report document
- Maintains records for compliance and tracking

## Wastewater Management Workflow

### Step 1: Wastewater Storage
**Process:**
- The wastewater is stored in the Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) or Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP)

### Step 2: Flow Rate Recording
**Process:**
- The wastewater flow rate is recorded by the STP operator using a flow meter

### Step 3: Laboratory Testing
**Process:**
- The Laboratory Officer conducts a lab test for water quality every month

### Step 4: Results Reporting
**Process:**
- The Laboratory Officer sends the lab results to HSE

### Step 5: Record Keeping and Reporting
**Process:**
- HSE keeps the lab report and shares it with the Building & Maintenance team
