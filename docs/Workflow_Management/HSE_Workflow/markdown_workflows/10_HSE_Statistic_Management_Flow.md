# HSE Business Work Flow - HSE Statistic Management Flow

## Overview
This workflow describes the process for collecting, analyzing, and reporting HSE statistics, including incident rates, hazard data, and performance metrics for management decision-making and compliance reporting.

## Data Collection Sources

### Primary Data Sources:
- **Incident reports** - from the incident management system
- **Inspection reports** - from routine and ad-hoc inspections
- **Additional HSE data** - from various HSE management systems

## Statistical Calculations and Metrics

### 1. Total Recordable Incident Frequency Rate (TRIFR)
**Formula:**
TRIFR = (Total number of incident cases / Total man-hours) × 1,000,000

**Definition:**
TRIFR is calculated from incident reports using the following formula to measure the frequency of recordable incidents per million man-hours worked.

### 2. Total Recordable Severity Frequency Rate (TRSFR)
**Formula:**
TRSFR = (Total number of lost time injury cases / Total man-hours) × 1,000,000

**Definition:**
TRSFR is calculated from incident reports using the following formula to measure the frequency of severe incidents resulting in lost time.

### 3. Lost Time Incident Frequency Rate (LTIFR)
**Formula:**
LTIFR = (Total number of lost days that caused partial or full school operation shutdown / Total man-hours) × 1,000,000

**Definition:**
LTIFR is calculated from incident reports using the following formula to measure incidents that result in operational impact.

### 4. Hazard Statistics
**Data Source:**
The total number of hazards is gathered from inspection reports, along with:
- Status of each hazard case
- Number of hazards reported on a monthly basis
- Types of hazards
- Non-conformance criteria
- Responsible actions
- Top ten unsafe conditions

## Data Processing Workflow

### Step 1: Data Collection
**Source:** Data collection from Incident report and Inspection Report

**Process:**
- Systematic gathering of data from multiple HSE systems
- Data validation and quality checks
- Data standardization and formatting

### Step 2: Statistical Analysis and Categorization
**Process:**
TRIFR, TRSFR, and LTIFR are broken down into three categories:
- **Study-related activities**
- **Work-related activities** 
- **Sport/physical activities**

Analysis includes combination of study and work-related activities, and are recorded based on the past five years up to the current year-to-date.

### Step 3: Hazard Data Analysis
**Process:**
Comprehensive analysis of hazard data including:
- Hazard identification trends
- Risk level categorization
- Monthly reporting patterns
- Corrective action effectiveness
- Top safety concerns identification

### Step 4: Statistical Chart/Diagram Creation
**Process:**
- Create the statistical chart/diagram
- Visual representation of trends and patterns
- Comparative analysis over time periods
- Performance indicator dashboards

### Step 5: Dashboard Publication
**Process:**
- Post it to the dashboard view
- Real-time data visualization
- Interactive reporting features
- User-specific access controls

### Step 6: Information Sharing
**Process:**
- Copy/share into BSJ Staff Portal (Google Site) under HSE Section
- Stakeholder communication
- Public reporting (where appropriate)
- Regulatory reporting compliance
