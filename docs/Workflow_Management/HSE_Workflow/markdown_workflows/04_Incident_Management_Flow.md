# HSE Business Work Flow - Incident Management Flow

## Overview
This workflow describes the process for managing incidents, from initial reporting through investigation, analysis, and implementation of control measures to prevent recurrence.

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Incident Report Received
**Process:**
- Report received by email or ticketing system or by phone
- Initial incident notification and documentation

### 2. Create Report Number
**Process:**
- Report Number using the following template:
  - **For Accident case:** Number/HSE-Accident/Month/Year
  - **For Near Miss case:** Number/HSE-Near Miss/Month/Year

**Accident Classification:**
- **Major:** If the accident causes a lost time injury or results in the partial or complete shutdown of school operations
- **Minor:** If the accident does not cause a lost time injury or the injury can be treated with first aid
- **Fatality:** If the accident results in the loss of life

### 3. HSE Conduct Investigation
**Actor:** HSE Team

**Process:**
- HSE Conduct Investigation and invite the respective team as needed
- Invitation could be sent by email, google calendar invitation or other platform

### 4. Analyse the Problem
**Process:**
- Using Human Factor Analysis Classification System (HFACS) or Incident Causative Analysis Method (ICAM)
- Systematic analysis of root causes and contributing factors

### 5. Determination of Control Measures
**Process:**
- The determination of control measures
- Control measure need to be approved by respective team that involve in the investigation

### 6. Assign Control Measures
**Actor:** The lead investigator

**Process:**
- The lead investigator assign the control measures to be executed with the due date setting
- Clear assignment of responsibilities and timelines

### 7. Action Execution
**Actor:** The assignee

**Process:**
- The assignee conducts the action and sends the report
- Implementation of assigned control measures

### 8. Verification
**Actor:** The lead investigator

**Process:**
- The lead investigator verify the reported action or control measures
- Verification and approval report to all the respective team members

### 9. Final Result
**Process:**
- Result report sent to the assignee and respective team member
- Respective team member could be the top management member, the investigation team, and the department head or manager

## Report Templates

### For Accident Cases
Report Number Format: **Number/HSE-Accident/Month/Year**

Required Information:
- Incident details and circumstances
- Injured party information
- Medical treatment provided
- Immediate actions taken
- Witness statements
- Environmental factors

### For Near Miss Cases
Report Number Format: **Number/HSE-Near Miss/Month/Year**

Required Information:
- Description of the near miss event
- Potential consequences
- Contributing factors
- Immediate corrective actions
- Preventive measures identified

## Analysis Methods

### Human Factor Analysis Classification System (HFACS)
- Systematic approach to identify human factors contributing to incidents
- Categories: Unsafe acts, preconditions, unsafe supervision, organizational influences

### Incident Causative Analysis Method (ICAM)
- Comprehensive investigation methodology
- Focus on organizational and systemic factors
- Identification of absent or failed defenses

## Investigation Team Composition

The investigation team may include:
- HSE personnel (lead investigator)
- Department representatives
- Subject matter experts
- Management representatives
- External specialists (if required)

## Control Measure Hierarchy

1. **Elimination** - Remove the hazard completely
2. **Substitution** - Replace with something less hazardous
3. **Engineering Controls** - Isolate people from the hazard
4. **Administrative Controls** - Change work practices
5. **Personal Protective Equipment** - Protect the individual

## Key Stakeholders
- Incident reporter
- HSE team
- Investigation team members
- Department heads and managers
- Top management
- Assignees responsible for control measures
- Witnesses and affected personnel

## Deliverables
- Incident report with assigned number
- Investigation report
- Root cause analysis
- Control measures plan
- Implementation verification report
- Final incident closure report
- Lessons learned documentation
- Communication to relevant stakeholders

## Documentation Requirements
- All incidents must be documented with appropriate classification
- Investigation findings must be evidence-based
- Control measures must be specific, measurable, and time-bound
- Verification of implementation must be documented
- Regular review and follow-up until closure
