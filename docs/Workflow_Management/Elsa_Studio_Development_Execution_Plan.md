   - **Mitigation**: Implement comprehensive logging and fallback authentication
   - **Contingency**: Use alternative authentication approach (cookie-based)

2. **Performance Impact**
   - **Risk**: Elsa Studio may impact overall application performance
   - **Mitigation**: Implement lazy loading and resource optimization
   - **Contingency**: Consider separate deployment if performance is unacceptable

3. **Browser Compatibility**
   - **Risk**: Iframe integration may have browser-specific issues
   - **Mitigation**: Test across all supported browsers
   - **Contingency**: Implement browser-specific workarounds or fallbacks

### Dependencies and Prerequisites
